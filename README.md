## Rent Calculator
This is an app I made to simplify calculating what is owed each month for rent and utilities. I have 2 roommates, 1 of which who is subleasing, so we all pay different amounts each month. I created this app during a rapid prototyping workshop. It was created with `angular-cli` and Tailwind CSS and (should be) fully reponsive both in your browser as well as your mobile device.

## To Do:
- Add validation on form
- Improve mobile view of tabs

## Rapid Prototyping Workshop Instructions:
1. Fork the repository 
2. Clone the repository
3. `cd angular-tailwind-starter/`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run dev`
6. Go to localhost:1236
7. Make a change to the HTML in `src/app/app.component.html` and save file
8. Go to localhost:1236 and see your changes! Hooray!
9. In the directory where you have installed ngrok, run `ngrok http 1236` and navigate to the link it provides.

Notes:
- Pushing to master will fail. You'll need to fork the repo, or clone then change the remote url.
